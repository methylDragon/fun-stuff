## Terminator Settings

Well... This isn't really a project per-se. But these are the settings I use for my Terminator. Because ain't nobody got time for vanilla Terminal.

Terminator lets you customise your Terminal and split it into panes for more efficient work!



### Applying The Settings

Install terminator first!

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install terminator
```

Then place the terminator folder into the ~/.config/ directory

```shell
$ sudo cp -r terminator ~/.config
```
