## Useful Scripts

### binary_count_up

This script can be used as either a module, or standalone!

If used standalone, it can take user input (or you can configure it manually) to print all binary numbers leading up to a target binary number.

If used as a module, it can do the same, but it returns a list instead, just pass the number you want to count up to with binary_count_up()
