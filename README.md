## Fun Stuff!

Sometimes, I can get bored.

Sometimes I can end up channeling that boredom into productive tasks.

Sometimes it ends up being productive in its own 'unique' way.



### Projects

**cowsay**

My own add-on for the fun cowsay program for linux!



**methylSwag**

Code signatures are fun to use. Especially during hackathons.



**Useful Scripts**

Just a bunch of random scripts. Go take a look to see what might interest you!



**Terminator Settings**

Well... This isn't really a project per-se. But these are the settings I use for my Terminator. Because ain't nobody got time for vanilla Terminal.
